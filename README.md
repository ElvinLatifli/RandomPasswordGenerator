I coded the code completely by myself. down to every detail. My aim is only to improve my knowledge and to provide help if anyone needs it. If you want to contact me, you can write to me on Instagram, Telegram or Gmail on my profile.

# SECURITY

- Character set: Assume a set of 94 characters, including uppercase letters (26), 
- lowercase letters (26), 
- numbers (10) 
- special characters (32)

Attack type: Assume a full brute force attack where the attacker will try all possible combinations of characters.
Based on these assumptions, the probability of your password being cracked can be calculated as follows:

Probability = Total possible combinations / Probability per trial

Total possible combinations = Number of characters ^ Password length

Probability per try = 1 / Number of characters

If we put these values ​​into the formula:

Probability = 94^36 / 94

Probability ≈ 2.74 x 10^107

This means the chance of your password being cracked is 1 in 2.74 x 10^107.

Conclusion
This calculation shows that an Instagram password that is 36 characters long and contains uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters is practically IMPOSSIBLE to crack with a brute force attack.

- I trust my application so much in terms of security that I even created all my passwords with this application.

# Modern RPG

This project provides the opportunity to generate very strong random passwords and keep them wherever you want by encrypting them. While I used html and css for the tutorial site in the project, I used python for the project itself and customtkinter for the interface.


## adds

I designed a website that works locally for the project, but frankly it wasn't very good because I was not a frontend developer and time was limited. I would be happy if you support me in website design!
