# Modern RPG

This project provides the opportunity to generate very strong random passwords and keep them wherever you want by encrypting them. While I used html and css for the tutorial site in the project, I used python for the project itself and customtkinter for the interface.


## adds

I designed a website that works locally for the project, but frankly it wasn't very good because I was not a frontend developer and time was limited. I would be happy if you support me in website design!
